// Hello! Welcome to the Bright Bridge Web react interview test. This test is made specifically for testing some basic react skills we require on a
// day to day basis. There will be 3 tasks, ranging from easy to hard. We expect you to be able to solve all 3 in one go, but obviously we understand
// any sort of challenges that may come up. 

// Here is the first task! Using hooks, please create a setState named name, and setName. Also, please make a useEffect statement that sets your name to 'Joe'.
// Also, create a button that updates the state to something else post render!
// Please display it in any way you would like!,
